## Learning GitHub actions

In my attempt to lear github actions here are some of the resources so far I have come across. 

* [doc.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-jobs-activity) - Understanding GitHub Actions


* [The Distillery](https://distillery.rbind.io/posts/2021-03-18-use-github-actions-with-r-markdown-and-distill/) - Use GitHub actions with R Markdown and Distill

### Testing

`r Sys.time()`

```{r}
dat=rnorm(100)

plot(dat)
